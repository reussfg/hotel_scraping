# hotel_scraping
This project has the goal of making a Web Scraping Program to dig the web URL of Hotels.  \n
The code was designed to a specific website called 'hotels.com'.\n
You must insert the specific link of the search page, that is, the *input* you must enter is the specific page of the search.\n
For an example:\n
  Main page --> www.hotels.com\n
  Specific page --> https://www.hoteis.com/search.do?destination-id=1742876&q-check-in=2021-11-03&q-check-out=2021-11-06&q-rooms=1&q-room-0-adults=2&q-room-0-children=0
